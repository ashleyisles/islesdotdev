# We're Engaged! üíç

Next year I get to marry my best friend! Here's how it happened:

### Leading Up

Enyi and I have lived together since 2019. It's been a wonderful experience, but one of the things that has never come easy in this situation is surprises. What also doesn't help is that Enyi can't keep a secret and I am practically an FBI agent. That being said, I started to get a lil nosy close to the time that he proposed. About a few weeks prior, we were at my parent's house and he'd been on the phone with someone (Mahesh I know it was you) about "some event". He usually does these on the weekends, and they only happen every so often (monthly I think). I'd asked him what was up and he said something mega weird along the lines of "Oh no big deal, I was just telling someone I couln't do something in a couple weeks". Now, at this time (and even now as I'm writing this) we were in the middle of a panoramic so the only "events"  he's had planned are these League Tournaments. So being the spy that I am, I deduced that he was skipping out on Clash in a couple of weeks. **(Clue #1)**.
